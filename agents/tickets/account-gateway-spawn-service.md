# Spawn account-gateway Service

## Context

`account-gateway` is the financial-aggregation service that consolidates accounts (bank,
brokerage, real estate-as-asset, etc.) into a unified ledger view. Originally intended as a
full KRE microservice (Postgres + outbox + events). Pivoted to a stateless pass-through over
Monarch Money's GraphQL API — see `docs/HLD.md` for rationale.

## Goal / acceptance

- Private GitHub repo `klaene-real-estate/account-gateway` created and populated.
- Kotlin/Spring Boot scaffold with minimal deps (no JPA, Flyway, Kafka, kre-events).
- `./gradlew :api:check` green.
- Service wired into `kre-stack` under `monarch` Compose profile, port 8084.
- `agents/context/CURRENT_STATE.md` seeded.

## Resolution

Completed in `feat/v1-pass-through-wrapper` (Stages 1–5). Merged to main.
Service is a stateless Monarch pass-through (no DB, no events). Auth bootstrap deferred to
`monarch-bootstrap-auth`. See `docs/HLD.md` and `agents/context/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
